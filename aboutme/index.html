    <h2>Ivan Miranda</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone, my name is Ivan and I'm excited to be part of this amazing University which is BYUI, I'm trying to be a really good programmer so I can work remotely from my home country, Bolivia, and earn a good amount of salary to give a better life to my family. I know for sure this university path will help me reach my future academic goals.
        <p>I have been a member of the church for some time now, it will be 7 years in October, and I'll never regret the decision I made to be baptized and know more strongly, my Savior Jesus Christ. I got to know about the church through my back then girlfriend, now being my wife! I got married a year and eight months ago and have one step daughter that is 12, a baby son just 6 months old, and another one coming..always dreamed of having a big family!
            <p>I'm currently studying to be a chef, almost done, and working as an appointment setter for a company that is located in Miami.
                <p>My favorite scripture is found in Mosiah 2:41!
                    FOREVER FAITHFUL!(Mission quote)
